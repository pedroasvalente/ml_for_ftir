## Running the Training Script

To run the `train.py` script, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv name_venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source name_venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     name_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install the Project in Editable Mode**:
    With the terminal inside the project.
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Run the Training Script**:
   ```bash
   python ml4fir/modeling/train.py
   ```

This will execute the training process as defined in `train.py`. Make sure to configure any necessary parameters or dependencies before running the script.
